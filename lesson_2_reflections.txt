What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When I initialize the repository an empty git repository is created. I need it to create .git directory in which meta data
and snapshots of different versions of the tracked files will be stored. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area holds the pointer to the changed files, it doesnt hold the files themselves. The changes made to the files which
are in the staging area are not yet commited and thus not yet in the git repository. The staging area helps to logically combine files into commits.
